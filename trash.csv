When I overcame a problem,

1
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.920
it was often from talking to somebody who had done the exact same thing that I

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.880
was hoping to do here for you to help you exactly where you

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.520
are now. Cause they've been there before

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.360
Too. This is your first time on here. Um, again,

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.680
this is the Deal Machine Masterclass. So excited for you guys to be with us.

I know, uh, again, I mean we're, it's hosted by Deal Machine,

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.080
but it's not about us. It's about you guys.

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.200
It's about investing in you and investing in your education and your team,

9
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.053
and your network,

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.080
and really coming to this where you're ready to learn and ready to meet other

11
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.120
people who are on this level, um, of real estate investing. So, um, that's our,

12
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.640
our purpose with this is really to bring in outside world class experts,

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.800
like Grunt Bowers here. Really excited to have him on today. Um,

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.840
but to give you the opportunity to just have conversations with him,

15
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.680
ask great questions, very specific about your business, and then again,

16
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.280
meet other people that are, are doing this stuff too. And we've had people meet,

17
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.520
future business partners aren't here. I know Jonathan and I always call you out,

18
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.840
but good seeing you too, man. Uh, you know, he's driving, but he,

19
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.720
he's teamed up with people on here in the past and done deals before.

20
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.720
So we've had people, uh, you know, again,

21
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.800
network with each other through that link that Ryan just shared right at the

22
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.340
bottom there.

23
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.280
So make sure to go it's deal machine.com/elite and you can jump in there and,

24
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.800
um, you know, uh, add yourself to that, that sheet, you know,

25
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.240
that networking sheet and just look for other people in your market right there

26
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.480
that have been on these before and are looking to team up with other investors.

27
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.200
So, um, no matter if you're wholesaling or flipping or buy and hold,

28
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.040
whatever your strategy is, you know, use, this is a network to tap into. Um,

29
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.920
I know we also have our Facebook group, uh,

30
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.520
our community group is really getting fired up and, and, uh,

31
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.000
getting people more and more involved in that.

32
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.280
So make sure to check that out too. I know, Ryan,

33
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.880
if you can share a link to that at some point too. There we go. Awesome.

34
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.800
Our community group out there.

35
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.040
Great place to meet other people who are doing deals. Great place to, um,

36
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.560
ask deal machine specific questions. Um,

37
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.480
I know we just put out our AI assistant, Alma, um, which Brent have you,

38
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.320
have you seen that yet? If not, I'll have to show it off at some point. Yeah,

39
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.840
it's brand new. It literally just came out.

40
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.840
So we have people in there talking about that too and how they're using that.

41
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.000
So make sure to get involved in the Facebook group.

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.120
That's an awesome resource for you guys. Um, you know,

43
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.880
if you have any deal machines, specific questions today,

44
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.600
I think the best place for those are really on Ryan's office hours, which, uh,

45
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.120
Ryan Hewitt my, uh, colleague on here. Uh,

46
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.000
he's the one who keeps dropping everything in the chat, helping us out. He, uh,

47
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.320
you know, he's got almost every single day office hours open. So check out the,

48
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.960
the Zoom chat right there to be able to bookmark that and use that as a way. Um,

49
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.520
oh, Paul, almost awesome. Fantastic. Love the feedback, man. Um, yeah, if the,

50
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.080

52
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.040

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.040
and then with these masterclass too, I mean,

55
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.920
we've done been doing this for over a year now,

56
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.640
so we've got a ton in the hopper, a ton of past ones, um,

57
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.480

60
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.440
I mean even like mental health,

62
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.560

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.400
So make sure you jump on there. Uh,

64
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.640

65
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.440
reach out to one of us so we can help get you to log in for that. But, um,

66
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.000
we've recently had on people like, um, David Richter was last week, uh,

67
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.480
who talks about profit first and, uh, you know, being able to,

68
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.960
to pay yourself first and, and, you know, make sure you do, uh, you know,

69
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.840
do quality deals, not just quantity deals. That was really good. Um,

70
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.680
we had Jake Connor before that who came on and talked about raising money,

71
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.080
like raising private money for your deals. There you go.

72
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.160
There's probably first love event. So Brent,

73
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.160
Brent knows what he's talking about. Uh,

74
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.640
so we had on the author of that we had on, uh, Jake Connor recently. We had on,

75
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.480
uh, Tommy Thornberg recently talking about tax and legal stuff. So, um,

76
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.800
excited for today to be really focused on vacant land, which is a,

77
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
a topic that we've not covered before. Uh,

78
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.360
something that Brent is the go-to guy, uh, for that world for, you know,

79
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.600
is an expert for our community,

80
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.440
and somebody who just puts out awesome content around that. So really,

81
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.360
really excited that he's, uh, you know, donating his time and coming on and,

82
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.160
and, and sharing his playbook with us today. Um,

83
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.200
I know I'll be starting off this call, David Leko. Uh, hey David. He'll,

84
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.320
he'll be jumping in and taking over, uh, you know, after a few minutes here.

85
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.440
But to kind of get us started for this call, um,

86
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.200
we always love to share good vibes with the community.

87
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.680
So if you guys can share like, any personal wins,

88
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.880
professional wins, you know, have you landed a deal recently?

89
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.840
Have you made a new hire you're excited about?

90
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.280
Have you started a new partnership? Like any,

91
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.690
any kinda small or big wins that you can jump in and share, uh,

92
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.050
would love for you guys to, to, to start us off that way. If,

93
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.770
if anybody's willing to unmute and say hello and, and, uh, share that with,

94
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.603
with us.

95
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.203
I've got one, Matt.

96
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.180
There we go. Jonathan, go. Uh, go ahead man. Good seeing you.

97
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.100
Good seeing you. Um, so two weeks ago when Jay Connor was on here,

98
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.060
I told him I was gonna take him to lunch.

99
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.140
And last Thursday we went to lunch in Morehead City,

100
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.780
which is about an hour and a half, two hours from where I live. Mm-hmm.

101
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.580
And we're basically in adjacent markets. Jacksonville,

102
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.500
North Carolina is the sort of, as far as I go towards Morehead,

103
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.060
when I was born in Morehead. So he's from Morehead,

104
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.140
so we had a lot in common there, and hell was on the Reboard, uh, 10,

105
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.140
12 years ago in Wilmington, and he came to speak there a couple times,

106
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.620
so I kinda knew him already. I just hadn't talked to him in a long time.

107
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.780
So we had a good time catching up for about an hour and a half.

108
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.420
Talked about all kinds of deals we're doing to,

109
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.620
hopefully we'll get something going together. So that's just another, uh,

110
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.100
connection through deal machine that I've made that I'm sure we'll get something

111
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.800
out of.

112
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.300
And I'm also doing more and more with Uncle Carl as time passes by.

113
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.900
I'm about to list something for him that I think I already have a buyer for,

114
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.400
which is one of the tax foreclosure sales that he's been working on for, gosh,

115
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.760
probably a year now. So if you just work it, stuff happens all the time.

116
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.880
So I'm winning every which way thanks to you guys.

117
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.800
Incredible. I love that, man. I mean, I,

118
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.280
I think like you are the shining or one of the shining examples of people who

119
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.720
are here every week. I mean,

120
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.440
you've been doing this I think for over a year now that you've been a regular on

121
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.640
these. And I feel like every one of these,

122
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.800
you come away with either something to implement your business or someone to

123
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.720
meet with that you follow through on. And I mean,

124
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.720
in the end deal machine in general,

125
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.840
like we're a tool that you've gotta take action on yourself and run with,

126
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.560
like will give you technology and knowledge like this to be able to help you in

127
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.980
that journey.

128
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.520
But the more proactive you are and the more disciplined you are about showing up

129
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.480
and taking action on what you learn here, the more you're gonna get out of it.

130
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.880
So, um, appreciate you, you know, speaking up on that, man.

131
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.880
Awesome. Anybody else, uh, have a deal they're, they're working on right now.

132
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.640
Anything that we can celebrate here together?

133
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.690
Not really a deal, Matt, but, uh,

134
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.250
I just purchased a engagement ring for my girlfriend.

135
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.490
She's actually in Marine Corps bootcamp currently, but, uh,

136
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.890
plan on proposing after she gets out of there.

137
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.750
Congrats.

138
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.450
That's awesome. Congrats. That's awesome.

139
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.450
How many real estate deals did it take?

140
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.690
Just the one

141
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.900
Boom. That's amazing. Here we go. That's so awesome.

142
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.780
It's actually the one I, uh, closed on last week, that 6,000

143
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.043
Deal.

144
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.190
Yep. That's, uh, that's what it went towards was buying that

145
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.120
Good use of funds. There we go. Yeah.

146
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.953
Congratulations.

147
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.133
Thanks.

148
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.610
Congrats man. Thanks for sharing that. Brent, do you have anything, uh, you,

149
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.970
that you can, uh, share in terms of your business right now? Ours, well,

150
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.970
First of all, I just wanted to say, hey again, Keefer, good to see you again,

151
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.410
as well as That's amazing. Congrats man. Um, yeah, you know,

152
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.130
I was gonna talk about it a little bit, um, but, uh,

153
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.810
I found the 150 lots with deal machine and the other day, well,

154
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.610
it was about a month and a half ago when I told you about it, Matt. Mm-hmm.

155
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.130
I was able to skip trace the guy directly from my truck, reach out to him.

156
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.990
I didn't get through on the phone number, but I found him on his Facebook. So,

157
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.070
you know, that's, that's another deal right there.

158
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.510
And I'm still in communication with that guy. Uh, we've been,

159
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.030
we probably chatted three times now. We had not struck up a deal,

160
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.670
but that's one of those long-term ones was like, you know,

161
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.390
that's gonna keep me busy for a little while. 150 lots. Okay. In Vero Beach,

162
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.223
Florida.

163
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.590
Awesome, man. So what'd you, how'd you even take

164
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.470
Down 150 lots? I haven't bought him yet. I haven't bought him yet.

165
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.870
So right now, this guy has,

166
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:40.380
how I found it was when you see a house pad and there's grass growing

167
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.660
on the house pad,

168
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.980
that tells me there's probably some motivation with that landowner because they,

169
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.620
they put a house pad there and they never built on it.

170
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.900
So the plan is to take 'em all down about 20 cents on the dollar and then

171
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.660
offload 'em to a larger builder.

172
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.440
That's, that's my plan anyways.

173
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.810
Amazing, man. I can't wait to hear more about it.

174
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.330
Great stuff. Um, anybody else, Melinda, share before I kick it to, to Brent?

175
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.220
Uh, I can share real quick how you guys know.

176
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.020
My name is Demetrius and I'm currently working on my first deal.

177
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.100
I got an offer today, it was low, but I'm still like,

178
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.260
hustling, grinding.

179
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.100
So it's just inspiring me to just get these tools to make my job a lot easier.

180
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.740
But I'm determined I'm never giving up and I'm in it to win it.

181
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.340
I just need more tools and more resources to do my job more effectively.

182
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.660
And I'm loving what you guys are doing here at Deal Machine.

183
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.190
I love to hear that man, that is inspiring. Uh, and you're taking,

184
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.030
you're clearly taking the right actions and like you said,

185
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.830
it's a matter of time. It's, it's, uh, not if it's when, so keep at it.

186
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.860
I think I wanna share, I think Dimitri is also just, just one, uh,

187
00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.140
year of deal machine from a challenge he's in with me, right. Nice.

188
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.340
Yes sir. Yes sir. We'll

189
00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.173
Make sure, congrats,

190
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.060
that's all running up and running for you when the challenge is done,

191
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.500
because you might win the grand prize. We'll see what happens.

192
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.500
Thank you. Thank you. I'm trying, I'm, I'm working hard.

193
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.990
Congrats again, man. Um, alright. Anybody else? Or I'll, uh,

194
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.270
kick this over to Brent here.

195
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.860
Yeah, I got one. Um, so we, we market, we fit,

196
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.100
we wholesale and fix and flip right here in Central Valley in California.

197
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.220
And we came across a lead that came down in Southern California. Uh,

198
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.940
wasn't sure what to do with it, uh, but luckily it ended up being,

199
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.380
uh, my first virtual wholesale, which is pretty exciting. Didn't walk it,

200
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.540
didn't anything, but, um, was able to find a buyer.

201
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.140
And so it was pretty exciting not to, uh, not to be nearby,

202
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.020
but being able to virtual virtually wholesale it. So it was,

203
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.020
it was pretty awesome.

204
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.080
Congrats, man. Love to hear that. Thanks for sharing that too.

205
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.920
And then Jose's another great example of somebody, you,

206
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.720
how many of these have you been on? You think, like,

207
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.200
feel like you're been a regular for a while too?

208
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.440
Yeah, I think I probably coming up on about a year.

209
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:09.160
Yeah. That's awesome. Good stuff, man. So he's another one. Definitely, uh,

210
00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.760
reach out to him if you're, you're in his market and, um,

211
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.593
appreciate you sharing that.

212
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.130
Yeah, and I actually have a deal that, um, we've been doing some data mining,

213
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.970
so I've kind of got some random stuff. If anybody knows any buyers in Alabama,

214
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.770
uh, I got a deal out there.

215
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.050
Nice. What city in Alabama?

216
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.033
Planton.

217
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.590
Where is that nearby?

218
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.940
Uh, it's not too far from, um, uh,

219
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.500
Birmingham. I think it's about an hour, an hour out.

220
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:46.300
Cool. We know Brian Tripp out in Birmingham, so maybe I'll ask him.

221
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.900
Ooh, okay. That's a good one. Yeah. Appreciate it.

222
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.443
Sure thing.

223
00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.070
Good tip. David, what do you think on your feet? Uh,

224
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.820
alright guys, well, um, appreciate everybody stepping up and sharing that. Um,

225
00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.140
I know Brent, just a quick little intro on him,

226
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.940
then I'll let him talk about his story and, and take over from here.

227
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.340
But he's a good friend of deal machine, you know,

228
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.220
he's the go-to guy again on really wholesaling land, vacant land,

229
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.980
anything vacant, land related. Uh, we love to bring him in as a,

230
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.300
an investor himself, but then also he coaches the land sharks really awesome.

231
00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.500
You got, he's got the shirt on right there. Uh,

232
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.220
really awesome group that he leads inside of Wholesaling Inc. And, uh,

233
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.820
is a former army mil, uh, army officer on his end too. So, um,

234
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:34.060
fascinating background, really awesome story from him. Um, you know, again,

235
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.380
if you wanna put your questions in the chat or hit the race hand button, uh,

236
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.060
David Leko is gonna be taken over from here to, you know,

237
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.340
kind of facilitate that. But, um, Breon welcome again,

238
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.620
really appreciate your time and, uh,

239
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.460
do you wanna maybe introduce yourself a little bit more to the people and uh,

240
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.300
you know, can let you take it from here?

241
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.420
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Thanks for having me, Matt. Thanks for the invite, Ryan.

242
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.300
So great to finally meet you Oak, good to see you again.

243
00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.980
And every time I get to see David Leko, I just,

244
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.180
I just get happy as well because, uh, just what, what, uh,

245
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.940
you've created here is just unbelievable.

246
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.420
I was talking to Matt a little bit before we, we, uh, jumped on. It's just,

247
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:11.750
you know, this is one of the,

248
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:16.870
the best ways for people to get started investing in real estate. Sorry, David,

249
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.320
I saw you un unmuted. Take it, take it over. I don't wanna talk to

250
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:20.380
You.

251
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.520
I'm still on Cloud nine since I ran into you and your wife about a month ago in

252
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.353
Phoenix.

253
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.380
Yeah, that was a good event. That was a great event. Uh,

254
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.900
we were at the whole Selling Ink Grow Summit, such a good event. Um, but, uh,

255
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.980
you know, going back to deal machine when we're,

256
00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.220
when I was getting started in 2016, I was freaking broke.

257
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.780
I was flat broke and I was also an Army officer, which is a little embarrassing,

258
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.300
uh, that I was a broke Army officer, uh, at, you know,

259
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.340
almost 28 years old. But here's the thing,

260
00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.460
it's like I didn't have any time and I didn't have any money.

261
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.860
So it's the hardest thing to get started.

262
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.740
But the good thing about deal machine is like,

263
00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.940
you can get the starter plan for $59 a month and then the pro plan for $99 a

264
00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.660
month. And I know all you guys are remembers, but this is just,

265
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.420
it's phenomenal because most of the,

266
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.980
the products out there are a hundred dollars or more.

267
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.500
So my hat's off to you guys for making it,

268
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.460
making it easy for people to get started.

269
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.580
I wish this was around back in 2016 when I was getting started.

270
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.940
I originally got, I originally got started in 2007.

271
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.180
I bought my first rental property, I got my real estate license.

272
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.860
I thought that's what you needed to be a good investor.

273
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.660
And then I threw in the towel in 2009. I was a, I was a big quitter. Um,

274
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.140
I like to tell people I, i, uh,

275
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:37.420
tried real estate from 2007 and I really didn't get successful until about

276
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.380
2016. So if you're kicking yourself in the butt,

277
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.260
if you're beating yourself up for not getting to where you want to be, uh,

278
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.180
as fast as you want to get there, give yourself some time. Like, imagine this,

279
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:52.280
like, when doctors become doctors, I mean they're, it takes 'em like nine,

280
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.800
10 years to make the money they're making guys.

281
00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.480
And as little as like a year, you know, congrats.

282
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.680
Keep Keefer congrats guys. Jose Calderon and your on, on your deals.

283
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.880
You're doing, like, we make more than doctors and attorneys.

284
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.080
And if there's a doctor and attorney on this call, please tell me if I'm wrong.

285
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.960
Um, but, and it doesn't take you long to do that.

286
00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:17.280
So my thing I'm here to talk about today is land investing. Uh, I'm gonna,

287
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.120
I really want to talk about one of the most scalable,

288
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.480
sellable cash machines that everybody, everybody is passing by.

289
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.920
And that's vacant raw land. I believe that,

290
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.680
that the reason why people are passing by on it is because you don't see an ugly

291
00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.920
house to take a photo with or take a picture and add it to your deal machine

292
00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.720
app. But guys, you pass raw vacant land and, and just gimme a show of hands,

293
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.400
who is doing deal machine virtually? All right?

294
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.640
Lower those hands who is just literally doing the old fashioned way,

295
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.720
driving your kids to school,

296
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.290
taking a different route every day and taking photos of the houses. I love it.

297
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.610
So you're basically doing both. Here's the thing,

298
00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.410
you could do the same thing with raw land.

299
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.010
You could put that pinpoint on there and send these guys a letter and I

300
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.210
guarantee you they're getting less letters. They're getting less phone calls,

301
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.260
less texts for, for,

302
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.860
for their land than that ugly house next door that needs a new roof or a new

303
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.780
window. So don't, don't keep passing by this stuff.

304
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.220
And I believe people are passing by it because you know,

305
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.180
HGT V hasn't made it sexy. You know, no one's talking about it.

306
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.780
I talked about this on stage at Whole Selling Inc.

307
00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.920
Gross Summit a couple about a month ago. I'm from Okeechobee, Florida.

308
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.960
It's a small town in Florida. No one's ever heard about it.

309
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.880
It's just a little south of Orlando. But our number one income,

310
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.280
basically our driver of income out there is cattle.

311
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.840
And I know a lot about cattle. I know that the herd, they go to get slaughtered.

312
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:49.320
So I try and do the exact opposite of what the herd does because I don't want to

313
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.880
get slaughtered and that's why I invest in raw vacant land.

314
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:56.280
How did I find raw vacant land? I was really running from an a problem.

315
00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.080
I got back in the real estate in 2013. Even though I was in the military,

316
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.120
I really started getting my stride about 2016 when I f found raw

317
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.880
vacant land. I was, I was started out as a wholesaler.

318
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.960
I was trying to wholesale houses.

319
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.920
I was spending a fortune sending out postcards and mailers deal again,

320
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.160
deal machine. I didn't know about it back then.

321
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.360
I don't even know if it was out back then. Uh,

322
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.600
but I was wasting money on postcards cause I was send out like a thousand

323
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.760
dollars worth of letters.

324
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.200
And then I would go to the field with the army because I was training for combat

325
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.800
deployment number three and I was searching for answers.

326
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.840
And I found the podcast,

327
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.520
a guy was talking about flipping raw vacant land and doubling his money

328
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.200
overnight. And I was like, listen, if it's that easy,

329
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.480
I am all in because I really wanted to get outta the military.

330
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.680
I was tired of deploying. I was on my,

331
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.720
I was prepping for the third combat deployment.

332
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.320
I was gonna be away from my family for another year and a half.

333
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.760
And I was just over it.

334
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.320
We had just had our first baby and I'm motivated by away from pain.

335
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.320
I'm not motivated by towards pleasure should I,

336
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.000
I believe there's two types of motivation away from pain or towards pleasure.

337
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.120
I was trying to run away from pain cuz I didn't want another divorce.

338
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.480
I didn't want another, uh, another failed marriage.

339
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.400
And this time children were involved. So I really hit the ground running.

340
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.360
I started mailing tax delinquent landowners.

341
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.280
I started mailing them a just a simple postcard saying, Hey, my name's Brent.

342
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.240
I'd like to buy your land in El Paso County, Colorado.

343
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.040
If you're interested in all cash fair price offer, call me or text me.

344
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:32.160
God bless you. And the phone started ringing. Now, fast forward several years,

345
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:34.600
I've really changed that strategy.

346
00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.960
It's evolved quite a bit and it's gotten a lot easier because

347
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:40.110
just,

348
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.950
just going through and making a bunch of mistakes has taught me a better way of

349
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:45.690
doing it.

350
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.710
So now I wanna talk to you guys about the system that I'm using and how you can

351
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.510
go out there and do a land deal in the next 30 days and get paid to do it.

352
00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.870
Please, uh, feel free. I don't, I don't, hopefully it's okay. Um,

353
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.670
I don't really know the rules of this, but feel free to unmute, come on,

354
00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:05.470
interrupt me, ask a question, put it in the chat however you want to do it.

355
00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.430
I'd love for this to be kind of a two-way street as well because I needed a

356
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.110
chance to breathe and take a drink of water. I talk fast as well,

357
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.990
but I want to talk about Y Sir David.

358
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.280
Yeah man. Uh, I was just curious,

359
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.840
do you think that because you're like trying to run away from pain and and not

360
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.840
run towards pleasure, that that's uh,

361
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.760
change and influence how your business is is built today?

362
00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.310
Yeah, it did. Um, the, now it's funny, the,

363
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:35.110
my business has also evolved because, you know, when I got outta the military,

364
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:39.430
I haven't had a real job since 2018. And when I got outta the military,

365
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:44.390
something called Parkinson's law set in the task expanded with the

366
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:48.910
time I now had available. So I scaled the company, I grew my team,

367
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.390
I had 15 people, my phone was ringing off the hook.

368
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.110
I had two acquisition managers, an in-house accountant,

369
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.550
all these virtual assistants.

370
00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.990
And it then turned into towards pleasure.

371
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.070
I wanted to build this big scalable business.

372
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.710
I wanted to puff out my chest and have an ego and prove that I was right to get

373
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:06.543
outta the military.

374
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:11.270
And then my wife called me out about almost two years ago now and said, listen,

375
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.590
like you literally left one job and created another one for yourself.

376
00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.590
And I was like, what are you, what are you talking about? She goes,

377
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.670
you said that when you got outta the military you would have more time for us.

378
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.510
Like, I get it, we got this money, we got the money,

379
00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.110
but now we never see you and you're like running around like a crazy person cuz

380
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.630
you're stressed out cuz you're doing all these deals and you're flipping houses

381
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.190
over here guys. I was, I was flipping ver seven houses virtually as well,

382
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.750
which is crazy. Like you see these gray hairs in my beard, like that's where,

383
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.590
where it came from. So

384
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.270
I don't you look 22,

385
00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:46.470
I just got a haircut, I shaved it off before this, this uh, this uh,

386
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:47.303
masterclass.

387
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.800
But I had to descale and now here's what my business looks like because

388
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.200
I didn't get into this land business.

389
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.760
I didn't create a land cash cow machine,

390
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.920
a passive income generating machine to get rich mul like to become a

391
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.680
multimillionaire land. Which it happened.

392
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.000
I did this to have more time with my family. So I'm now kind of living it.

393
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.040
I took off almost all the month of March.

394
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.060
And then we're also going to Costa Rica for six weeks. We're leaving in June.

395
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.140
So I'm living it, you know, and it all came from it.

396
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.220
The whole thing came from the four hour work week.

397
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.860
That's where the idea came from. So now it's towards pleasure, but,

398
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:29.100
but time pleasure, time freedom. To answer your question David. So

399
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:35.070
to get into the system, and again, please, Phil, interrupt, come on mute,

400
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.310
whatever you wanna ask, ask me. I will answer anything on this call. Um,

401
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:45.000
I now with this land system, I go and look for for demand,

402
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.520
the demand areas.

403
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.160
I used to buy land all over the country like in the middle of nowhere for

404
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.600
pennies on the dollar. And I'd work really hard to sell it for like,

405
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.240
and I would like get like, you know, 20 x 30 x returns,

406
00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.880
but I had to work hard to do it.

407
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.880
So now that the whole system has changed and go in and I find where the demand

408
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.440
is at, where the land's selling at, and you can do that with free things like,

409
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.200
you know, Redfin and Zillow. You know,

410
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.360
choose your market that you're currently living in right now,

411
00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.360
put it in Redfin and then go.

412
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.920
And then you're gonna want to go to all filters and click that and then click

413
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.480
select land and then sold.

414
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.080
You wanna look at the sold land and then scroll down a little bit and do the

415
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.640
last 30 days and then go back to where you put in your area.

416
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.120
Let's just say it's Orlando, Florida and exit that out.

417
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.320
And then you just wanna zoom out of the map and you wanna see where the solds

418
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:41.840
are at, where the red dots, if you're on Redfin or yellow Dots, if you're on on,

419
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.640
on Zillow. And if you don't see any solds, then go to the last three months,

420
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.920
go back over there to filters and go to three months.

421
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.320
And when you see those clusters of dots,

422
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.120
that's gonna show you where the land is selling,

423
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.520
that's where that's gonna show you where people are buying land.

424
00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:00.200
And then you can power that with deal machine and go and literally virtually

425
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:04.480
start mailing people in those areas. But there's a little bit more to it,

426
00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.280
you know, when you go back to Redfin,

427
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:11.280
you wanna see what size parcel is in demand, what size parcel is selling.

428
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:16.260
So if you click on all 10 of those red dots and you see that one is a half acre,

429
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.780
half acre, half acre, one acre, half acre, half acre,

430
00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.340
okay half acre parcels are in high demand.

431
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.380
Next you wanna start writing down what those half acres are selling for.

432
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.220
And then let's just say it's 10 half acre parcels. One sold for 12,000,

433
00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.020
one sold for 14,000, one sold for 12.

434
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.740
So add 'em all up and divide it by how many you added up.

435
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.900
And that's gonna give you the average price per half acre parcel that's selling.

436
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.240
Now when you know that it's time to go pull a list or it's time to start mailing

437
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:48.320
these landowners and you could do that through the deal machine app so easily

438
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.600
just driving for dollars virtually or you could physically,

439
00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:55.600
physically get in your car and do it. But that's really the whole system.

440
00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.480
And I'm gonna pause there for just a second. If I lost anybody,

441
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.560
I wanna make sure before I move on that, that that's solid.

442
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.510
Yeah, thanks for explaining how to value the land.

443
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.270
I've definitely passed it over cause I was like, ah, I don't understand that.

444
00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.030
I'm gonna focus on stuff. I understand, but you made it so simple.

445
00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:11.350
Now my question is,

446
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.550
if you get a value after you add all those up and then you divide 'em by how

447
00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.550
many pieces of land you just totaled up,

448
00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:23.150
what percentage under value are you trying to get this under contract for?

449
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:26.590
Oh, such a great question. So David, you know,

450
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.750
when I first started out I was just like mailing,

451
00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.750
like it depends like the cheaper land I was getting that stuff,

452
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.150
like when I say cheap land, I mean under $10,000,

453
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:38.590
I was getting that stuff at like 8 cents on the dollar because here's the thing,

454
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.550
I had to get at it for, for like less than 10 cents on the dollar.

455
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:46.720
So that means I'm paying a thousand bucks for this piece of land I can sell for

456
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.560
10,000. Pretty good spread, right?

457
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:53.560
Nine grand and a lot of that I was selling for 10 grand what it was worth

458
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.160
on seller financing. And that allowed me the income stream of, you know,

459
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.200
couple hundred dollars a month for each one of those parcels of land.

460
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.960
Now if you get into more expensive land,

461
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.800
let's just say a hundred thousand dollars parcel,

462
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.680
the land's selling for a hundred thousand for a half acre.

463
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.440
And some people might be like, well I don't have a hundred thousand,

464
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.880
I can't buy it. There's so many ways to do that.

465
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.520
You can assign the contract or you can literally, you know,

466
00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.840
you can buy it with friends and family and partners. Like my father-in-law,

467
00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.960
we invest in land together.

468
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.720
He pulled all of his money outta the stock market and we buy land together.

469
00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.200
And most of the time I have a buyer ahead of time before we even buy it.

470
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.990
So we used the buyer's funds as the payment for the land.

471
00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.510
So going back to that, to what, what how I offer,

472
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.110
let's just say it's a hundred thousand dollars parcel.

473
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.550
Well I take my pen and paper, now write,

474
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:46.270
it's selling for a hundred thousand and then I subtract what I wanna make,

475
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.950
which is l at least $10,000 per deal. So all right,

476
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:51.990
now I need to offer 90,000 for that parcel.

477
00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.350
But what about if I have a realtor help me sell it. I like,

478
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:55.790
I want help selling this stuff.

479
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:59.230
I don't wanna have to be marketing this stuff and putting out signs and putting

480
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.870
Craigslist ads and Facebook ads.

481
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.190
I've done that for so many years with the cheaper land.

482
00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.790
But once you get to that a hundred thousand dollars mark or even the $50,000

483
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:11.470
mark realtors, land specialist realtors will help you disposition this stuff.

484
00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.470
So that took almost half the work off of my plate and that's what allows me to

485
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:19.990
have one acquisition manager now one executive assistant and one

486
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.113
accountant.

487
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:26.390
That is how small my team is Now we are way more profitable. I got,

488
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:29.430
I was able to get rid of multiple virtual assistants.

489
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.830
I was able to get rid of my land cell specialists that was calling people all

490
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.310
day long returning calls.

491
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:39.510
And I got rid of so many subscriptions like land.com, land century land hub,

492
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.330
land motor.

493
00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:44.600
That's saving me almost $2,000 a month right there on all those subscriptions

494
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.640
because the realtors have those subscriptions.

495
00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.960
But going back to that a hundred thousand dollars example,

496
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:52.410
so I wanna make 10 grand,

497
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:56.680
so I need to offer less than 90 and the realtor's gonna charge me about 6%.

498
00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:01.600
So let's subtract 6,000 from that and then just figure another like 4,000 for

499
00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.520
closing costs, back taxes or whatever. So now we're at, what, 80,000?

500
00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:10.080
So I'm taking a hundred thousand minus my $10,000 profit minus another 10,000

501
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.080
for closing costs and realtor trophies. So now we're at 80.

502
00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.480
Let's just figure out buyer's discount. What do I mean by that?

503
00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.080
When I list the land on the multiple listing service or with the real estate

504
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.960
agent, I want to be cheaper than everybody else. It's not, Hey honey,

505
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.360
this one has granite. Hey, this one has a pool. No,

506
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.840
this one's dirt and this one's dirt and it's 5,000 less than everything else.

507
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.400
So where's that put me at? About $75,000, right?

508
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.760
So I need to offer about 75 cents on the dollar if I'm going after a

509
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.280
hundred thousand dollars properties.

510
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.800
Got it. So you basically take uh, what you wanna make, which is at least 10,000,

511
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:50.080
subtract it from the price, subtract the realtor's feet of 6% when they sell it,

512
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.600
and then, then subtract another five grand so that you're the cheapest one.

513
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.440
And and maybe this answer is Rihanna Murray's question,

514
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.720
she just put in the chat.

515
00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.760
How do you market it so you have a seller ahead of time because she sees landit

516
00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.720
for months and years. Is there anything else or is that the magic formula?

517
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.240
Yeah, so let me just make sure I read that. Um, how do you market it?

518
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.320
You have a seller ahead of time. I think Rihanna,

519
00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.080
do you mean buyer ahead of time? I see the land sit for months, years.

520
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.350
So if I understand that correctly,

521
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.830
I have a buyer most of the time before I buy the land.

522
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:25.190
So let me just talk about a deal I'm doing in Florida right now.

523
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:30.710
So I found almost seven acres that is right next to the water

524
00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:34.110
in Florida. We're buying it for $150,000.

525
00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.470
The seller is giving me six months,

526
00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:42.750
six months to market this land on the m l s and Craigslist and

527
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:45.230
Facebook and sign six months to find my buyer.

528
00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:49.470
And he's also gonna sell or finance me for 15 years at 5% interest.

529
00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:54.270
So his payment is gonna be almost $1,100 a month. And he's stoked about it.

530
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:59.260
I've already gotten a letter of intent from a buyer because we've, we,

531
00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.300
we listed it a couple of weeks ago. We've already gotten a letter of intent,

532
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.300
intent for $239,000 and we're gonna finance this buyer

533
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.260
for 30 years at 12% interest. So my buyer'ss payment is gonna be, uh,

534
00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:17.040
2200 a month and my seller's payment that I paid,

535
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.840
that the seller's gonna be roughly 1100 a month.

536
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.800
So I'm keeping the difference of, of about a thousand dollars a month,

537
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:24.960
plus I'm getting a down payment of 30 grand from this buyer.

538
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.400
So I'm gonna be profitable in the beginning, all throughout and at the end.

539
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.960
Now is this guy gonna do 30 years of financing? No.

540
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.920
What he's gonna do is he needs me to finance it for 36 months roughly.

541
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:41.000
He's gonna go in and build roads, he's gonna build a beautiful picket fence,

542
00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:44.800
he's gonna raise the land, he's gonna improve it. And in 36 months,

543
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.480
I don't even know how to figure that math. So he's paying two grand a month,

544
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:52.200
so 36. So he is gonna pay me over what, $72,000.

545
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.600
I'm no math magician. But here's the thing,

546
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.360
if you look at that amortization schedule,

547
00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:00.760
he's still gonna owe me about $235,000.

548
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:06.080
So we're gonna make over almost $200,000 on this land

549
00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.960
and it's gonna cost me zero money outta my pocket.

550
00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.080
That's how I find my buyer before I even buy the land.

551
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.400
Does it always work that way? No, but here's the thing, most landowners,

552
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:21.120
they're so unattached, they're so unemotional, they're so like disengaged,

553
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.080
they're unemotional about the land because they didn't raise their family in

554
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.480
this, this, on this land. Like it's not the house,

555
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.280
It's not making money either too.

556
00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.520
So it's actually just costing them money the longer they hold it, right?

557
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.320
They're paying property taxes. And uh, I wanted to give permission,

558
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.640
Justin French has a question he just unmuted.

559
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.280
Yeah, please go ahead Justin. Sorry.

560
00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.800
Hey, hey this is, this is exciting talking about, I've never really uh,

561
00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.120
considered vacant land cuz it's just, you know,

562
00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:51.280
don't really know what to do with it. That feels like a, you know,

563
00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.520
a builder's world. But, um, there is quite a few, um,

564
00:30:55.790 --> 00:31:00.480
lots here in Utah that I see on a regular basis. Um, and I'm, you know,

565
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.560
with wholesaling it's kind of like find the seller first and then there's plenty

566
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:08.040
of buyers to go give it to. But would you say that you,

567
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:12.960
it's better to have a buyer that's actually in your pocket and then go

568
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.360
find the lots?

569
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:20.310
No, I I think it's better to find the deal because here's the thing,

570
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:23.030
there's so many ways, so let me go, let me back up.

571
00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:27.910
When I was just starting re remember I talked about spending thousands of

572
00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.510
dollars on, on mailers to find a deal.

573
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:35.390
I had already built a cash buyer'ss list of hundreds of home buyers that

574
00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:40.070
wanted me to find them a deal. How much was that cash buyer's list making me?

575
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:46.160
Not a single penny. It was costing me money cuz I had a MailChimp, uh,

576
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.280
that I was paying for every month, but it wasn't making me a penny.

577
00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:53.560
Now if I would've reversed that and I would've had the house deals found out

578
00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:58.160
who's the cash buyers buying in the 3 2901 zip code right now

579
00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:02.190
they own five or more parcels of land and

580
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:04.360
they bought in the last year.

581
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.360
And I skip trace those and I just text them or I call 'em, say, Hey, you know,

582
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.680
I see that you purchased a half acre parcel of land for $50,000. Um,

583
00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.480
I'm just gonna go ahead and cut right to it. I have a parcel of land,

584
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:20.560
it's a half acre on the same street. I will sell it to you for 45,000.

585
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.880
Do you want it? No. Okay. And then call the next person 45,000.

586
00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:29.240
I have it under contract for 30,000 mine. You I'm gonna make a quick $15,000,

587
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.120
but I already have the gold, I just need to offload it to somebody.

588
00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.080
So I say get the deal first, then sell it to a cash buyer.

589
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:40.160
Okay. Yeah, because like, yeah, because you guys just made the point,

590
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.120
like it's a little different when you're sitting on a piece of land and you

591
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.600
know, and you're not emotionally attached,

592
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.120
like you said cuz you didn't raise a family and all this so much easier.

593
00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.600
You know, but it's, um, but that statement,

594
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.240
it was just made about it actually costing them money by just sitting on it.

595
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:55.940
So they're pro,

596
00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.130
it seems to me like there's quite a bit of motivation there to Oh

597
00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:00.940
Absolutely. To

598
00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.770
Wanna sell that piece of that piece of land.

599
00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:05.530
So now when you go find a a buyer though,

600
00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.690
you're looking for somebody that's wanting to do home.

601
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.890
Like if you're trying to wholesale that deal, um,

602
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.810
you're not just wholeselling it to any old investor that usually does flips,

603
00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:16.490
right? You're like,

604
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:20.530
you're looking for somebody who's more specialized in building new,

605
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:21.623
new construction.

606
00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:23.890
It can literally be anybody. Uh,

607
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:28.250
we just sold a piece of land to a retired couple. Uh,

608
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:31.810
they just wanted a piece of land in Florida because their plan was to come here

609
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:36.890
in the next 12 months and build on their new, new parcel of land.

610
00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.810
So sometimes it's builders, sometimes it's end buyers,

611
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.450
sometimes like for instance, this, this, uh, this seven acres of land,

612
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.210
it's uh, gonna be a developer.

613
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.770
Like he is gonna build several houses on stilts that you can oversee the water.

614
00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:53.770
So it, there's a buyer for every piece of land. When I first started,

615
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:57.730
my first piece of land was $285 in Palmer Lake, Colorado.

616
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.850
Had no clue how to figure out what was was even worth. So I drove to it,

617
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:04.730
it was 45 minutes from Fort Carson where I was stationed.

618
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.430
And I mean, I'll tell you what, God like literally blessed me.

619
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:12.830
Like I saw a real estate office really close to the land.

620
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:15.270
It was like down the hill. So I called that real estate office.

621
00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:19.750
Guess who bought the land from me for $5,000? It was that realtor I called.

622
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:21.470
Really? So, yeah.

623
00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:24.390
Did you say you bought it for 285 bucks?

624
00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:25.950
You got it. You heard that right?

625
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.390
What it was,

626
00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:31.630
It was uh, a non-billable piece of land. It was on the,

627
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.430
the county held tax lie list.

628
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:38.910
What that means is a tax lie investor didn't even pay the back taxes.

629
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:43.630
That's how worthless that land was. It was just junk junk land.

630
00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:47.350
It was not buildable because there was only one ingress in egress one road.

631
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.030
So the fire department wouldn't allow anybody to build on it.

632
00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.510
So this realtor was speculating. She's like,

633
00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.950
one day the city's gonna allow that road over the railroad tracks.

634
00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:00.550
So she bought it for me for 5,000. You know what, she sold it for like $32,000.

635
00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:04.310
So she low balled the heck outta me, but I needed money back then.

636
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:08.240
Yeah, well you know, if you flipped 2 85 to five grand,

637
00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.800
I mean that's that's fine. Take it and run, right? Like that's great.

638
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:15.430
So now how did you find that? How,

639
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.470
what was your method in finding the property or finding that, that

640
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:19.910
First one, that $285 one?

641
00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.050
Yeah,

642
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:24.780
That's back when I just sent postcards to the tax delinquent list. Yeah.

643
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.980
It was a simple postcard saying, Hey, my name's Breen.

644
00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.820
I'd like to buy your land in El Paso County, Colorado.

645
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.380
If you're interested in all fa or all cash fair price offer,

646
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:36.740
call me or text me and I'll off, I'll give you guys that postcard.

647
00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:41.400
Just go to the, to the land sharks.com/postcard.

648
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.280
It's the tribe postcard. It's the one we use at Wholesaling Inc.

649
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.490
Okay. And so, and then where,

650
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.570
where are you going to get the tax delinquent list from? Yeah.

651
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.210
Okay.

652
00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:55.250
So one of the easiest places to go is directly to the county treasure's office

653
00:35:55.310 --> 00:36:00.170
or directly to the tax collector's office. Now let me just disclose this.

654
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.370
I don't do that anymore. Okay?

655
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:07.250
I just go and do that exact system that I was just talking about where I

656
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.970
find that area of demand, that little pocket and guys, if it's a neighborhood,

657
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:13.930
you could be as micro as you want in real estate.

658
00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:17.170
I try and get as micro as possible cuz I don't like throwing a bunch of

659
00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:21.610
spaghetti on the wall. I prefer to use like a sniper approach. So I,

660
00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:23.050
I get that area of demand,

661
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.930
then I figure out what's in demand and then I blast them with mailers. I,

662
00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:28.890
I actually send what I call the land offer letter,

663
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:33.890
the l o l because every time I get one back I'm like laughing out loud because I

664
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.650
just got a smoking hot deal on a piece of land.

665
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.130
And I'll give you guys that as well.

666
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.770
I'm triple split testing this exact mailer.

667
00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.410
It's working better than that postcard I just talked about.

668
00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:47.010
It's working better than sending fake looking checks.

669
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.770
It's working better than neutral letters.

670
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:52.370
But you guys can get that land offer letter and that I'm triple split

671
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:57.170
testing@thelandsharks.com slash l o

672
00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:58.970
l and use it,

673
00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:03.690
start sending these right now and you can get the mailing addresses. And David,

674
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.690
if you want to add that to deal machine, feel free. Like, you know,

675
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.730
I know you guys have that awesome postcard. You just puts a picture of the land.

676
00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:11.810
Like there's nothing better than that. Yeah,

677
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:15.410
I was just gonna say, you can upload that, that postcard into deal machine.

678
00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.450
Yeah. If you wanted to send it out through that way.

679
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.740
Yeah, I think it's already in there. It was in mine. I'm pretty sure

680
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.530
It definitely probably could be.

681
00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:25.730
I always like get on it

682
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:27.850
David. We want that. Get on it. You

683
00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:28.683
Can upload,

684
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:30.170
You can upload it right now.

685
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:35.810
I liked it though when they got a picture of the land or the house.

686
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:36.643
Because here's the thing,

687
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:41.370
my sister-in-law just inherited a piece of land and a lot of people go after

688
00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.450
like the people that I've owned it for three or more years and they're outta

689
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.330
state. Well here's the thing, my sister-in-law lives in the same state.

690
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:53.530
She just took ownership of it and she is trying to get rid of this land because

691
00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:58.060
she was, she is p****d off. Like her and her mom had a terrible relationship.

692
00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.420
She's like, my mom's getting me one more time from the grave.

693
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.820
I'm thinking to myself, she left you five acres from Florida.

694
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.620
Are you kidding me? Now I didn't, I didn't go and offer to buy that one.

695
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:10.540
I wanted to separate myself from that one. But like everyone's going after the,

696
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.780
the, the out-of-state owners and they've owned it for multiple years. When land,

697
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:17.260
when you're dealing in land, you don't have to do that.

698
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.580
So going back to, uh,

699
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.820
that question that was asked about how to get the tax delinquent list.

700
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.340
So in Florida there's something called a tax collector in Colorado

701
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.620
it was the treasurer, the county treasurer.

702
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:36.360
These are the guys in charge of making sure that people pay their back tax,

703
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.600
people pay their taxes on their houses and their land and their mobile homes.

704
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.880
And it's very easy to go and get that list. Sometimes you can just do it online.

705
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.400
So if that's the route you want to take, absolutely go.

706
00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.640
That's a low hanging fruit. Now if these counties are charging for it,

707
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.960
I wouldn't pay it. There's way better systems like, you know,

708
00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:59.600
deal machine to get those lists off of and or just get the whole county list,

709
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.240
the whole actual list where there's demand and micro it down.

710
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:06.600
Okay. And you, like you said, you like Redfin though.

711
00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:10.760
Redfin seems to be good for locating those, uh,

712
00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.400
those hot spots you said that have a lot of clusters of selling properties.

713
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.120
Exactly. Or Okay. Yeah.

714
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:20.920
Yeah. I just put in my actual location cause I try, so when I first started out,

715
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.200
I did it in my own backyard. Now I do it virtually.

716
00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.400
I I you can literally live anywhere. There's deals everywhere right now.

717
00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:30.520
So I'm going to Costa Rica here. So I'm not driving to this land.

718
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:35.520
I'm buying five acres in Daytona Beach on Friday. I have never been to the land.

719
00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.000
I'm confident though it's gonna be an amazing deal because I'm buying it for

720
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.360
less than 50 cents on the dollar.

721
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:44.120
Like hopefully there's not like 16 gofer tur tortoises over there.

722
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:47.120
I'll have to pay $3,000 a piece to transport 'em,

723
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.000
but it's still gonna be a profitable deal if I do that.

724
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:54.410
Man, gold. Oh, I'm so glad I joined this call today. It was awesome.

725
00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.410
Appreciate your, um, your information.

726
00:39:57.150 --> 00:40:00.200
Yeah, my pleasure. Let's, let's keep rolling. Brent, Brent

727
00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.560
Bowers doesn't gate kef, he shares. I know. Darryl,

728
00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.360
you got a question for a little while. Do you want to unmute and ask?

729
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:13.020
Thank you very much David. Good to see you. Uh, Brent,

730
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:15.580
thank you very much for your time. All right, I got a couple for you.

731
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.270
You ready for me?

732
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.420
Let's go. Yeah. And I'm sorry I didn't even see that hand.

733
00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.740
Like I'm a little colorblind. Um, guys, you don't have to be so polite.

734
00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:22.700
You can unmute and just

735
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:25.283
What hand?

736
00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:26.713
Oh, okay.

737
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.220
No, I'm just messing right. I took it off. Um, all. So, um, I'm from Miami,

738
00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:36.020
Florida. I've definitely heard of, uh, Okeechobee before. Uh, but anyway, so,

739
00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:40.300
so my question was, uh, how do you determine or stay away from, uh,

740
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:45.420
swamps, unbuildable sinkhole? You're from central Florida? Yeah.

741
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.850
Holy

742
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:50.300
Crap. I'm definitely afraid of those things. A sink hole that's I'm telling you.

743
00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.740
Like that's my, I would think that would be the worst place, worst way to die.

744
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.100
But anyways, this is a positive call. Um, how do I stay away from it? You know,

745
00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:00.300
I've made a lot of money with wetlands.

746
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:04.940
My dad has 10 acres of cypress swamp. So he actually has 21 acres,

747
00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.780
but 10 acres of it. He can't touch it. It's Cypress Swamp.

748
00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:13.240
He leases that land out for $6,000 a year to a

749
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:18.080
deer hunter. And, you know, there's money in, in the wetlands.

750
00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:22.440
Uh, once I bought a mud hole, uh, acre in a quarter on, uh,

751
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.000
something called the Viking, you might have heard it.

752
00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.720
A we sell it to a lot of people in Miami. Uh,

753
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:31.040
they come and move to Okeechobee and camp out on the Viking or build their

754
00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.680
house, but a lot of that is wetlands and just mudding area.

755
00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.360
So you find the area,

756
00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:41.520
you figure out the area and like these parcels have no

757
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:42.833
property address.

758
00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:47.360
That's how we know that the land is not buildable and or it's a wetlands.

759
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.920
Now if it does have a property address,

760
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:50.960
it's a little higher and dryer and you can build on those.

761
00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.560
And how did I learn that?

762
00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.000
I literally just had to go into the area and I made a huge mistake.

763
00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:00.480
I was offering like for every 1.25 acre parcel,

764
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.600
the price of what a buildable lot would sell for.

765
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:08.040
And I had almost 15 people sign and return my l o l my land offer letter.

766
00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.120
And I was like freaking out. I was like, holy crap, I'm a genius.

767
00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:16.040
And my dad goes, no son. Like those parcels that don't have addresses.

768
00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.080
And I got him into land too, by the way. He's done over 60 land deals.

769
00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.840
My dad's 60 years old, he's no longer doing manual labor. Like,

770
00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.160
he's like literally getting skin cancer cut off of his body because he's just

771
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.080
done, he's worked in the sun his whole life. But he is like, no son.

772
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:34.440
If it doesn't have an address, like 1 23 Main Street, Okeechobee, Florida,

773
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:38.360
that means it's not buildable, it's wetlands. I was like, oh, okay.

774
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.400
So I had to remail.

775
00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.880
So it's really just kind of getting in your area and learning.

776
00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.480
But here's how I could have avoided that.

777
00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:50.140
I could have looked on Redfin and clicked on all those solds and

778
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.750
figured out who was the listing agent,

779
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:57.070
who it says it was listed by and who it was bought by. How do you see that?

780
00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:00.310
So you click on the link, the red, the red dot where it's sold,

781
00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:04.070
and scroll all the way down and see who it's listed by and who it's bought by.

782
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:06.430
That's gonna be the listing agent and the buyer's agent.

783
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.270
And eventually you're gonna see a pattern. Okay,

784
00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:12.110
David Leko is selling all the land in Miami, Florida. All right, so call David.

785
00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:15.430
Hey, I'm looking at this piece of land. It's on 233rd street.

786
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.510
What is your blowout price for this? What can you,

787
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:21.470
what is to get it done now price. What can I sell this land for really quick?

788
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.190
It's a half acre and he's gonna, well, you know,

789
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:28.110
that street doesn't have electric or water or sewer,

790
00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:30.030
but if you go two streets over, it does,

791
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:33.230
like the land specialist realtors are gonna be like your,

792
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.550
just literally just your, your secret weapon.

793
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:43.060
Um, and I I got another one for you. Uh, your top five resources to find buyers,

794
00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:47.460
especially we're, we're working very local, but we want to, uh, start expanding.

795
00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:49.020
Yeah. Um,

796
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:54.100
so one of the best ways for me to find buyers right now is I put the land on the

797
00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.660
mls. Now I don't own all this land that I put on the mls.

798
00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.860
I have a seller's acknowledgement.

799
00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:02.900
Just basically it's saying that I can market it anywhere.

800
00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:07.340
I'm gonna be reselling this land immediately and making a profit on it and I can

801
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.540
even put it on the mls. That's the best way.

802
00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.740
That's how you find kind of the world of cash buyers. Um,

803
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.980
now check with an attorney to make sure you can do that.

804
00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.140
A real estate attorney in the state you're in, uh,

805
00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:22.100
number two resource is you pull that list or you could pull it in deal machine

806
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.860
and call these guys and say, look,

807
00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:28.220
I got a half acre lot right next to the one you just bought.

808
00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.180
Are you interested in purchasing this one?

809
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:33.440
I can give it to you for one or for for 145,000.

810
00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:38.320
And you see they just paid 160,000 for the same lot. You know, you got a buyer.

811
00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.760
So that's a couple ways to find cash buyers.

812
00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.760
I know that that answer got a little long there.

813
00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.740
No, that was amazing. Thank you so much, Brent, for showing the details.

814
00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.540
I always like to see exactly how it works.

815
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:55.650
Any, I know we got like four minutes left. Any more questions?

816
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.220
Uh, I just got a quick question.

817
00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.473
Go ahead.

818
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:02.050
All right. So I remember when you were saying,

819
00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:05.290
you were talking about your sister in Florida. Is she working with a agent?

820
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.010
My, my sister in Florida,

821
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:11.410
Yes. You said you would stay away from that deal. Is she working with the agent?

822
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.810
Oh, you

823
00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:16.450
Said she Oh, oh. I already passed her off to one of my sharks. Okay.

824
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:19.090
Ok. Sister-in-law had an opportunity.

825
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:22.730
You threw me off, but I love that you asked that question. Yes. I,

826
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.770
I already passed her off to, uh, one of my, my sharks and he called her.

827
00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:30.610
She hasn't even returned his call. Like, she's like, come on,

828
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:33.200
I'll follow up in about a week.

829
00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.120
Yes. Yeah, follow up. Absolutely.

830
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.060
Was there somebody else that had a question? If not, I have one more.

831
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:40.620
Yeah, go ahead. I think,

832
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:41.620
Uh, Hal, you're gonna,

833
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.460
Uh, yeah, I had just a quick question going back. Um,

834
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.940
when you were talking about selling plots of land,

835
00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.540
you mentioned that there was like a couple you sold a plot of land to,

836
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:51.980
how'd you go about finding buyers that way?

837
00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.550
Um, I'm not sure exactly know what you're, you're,

838
00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:01.660
you're asking you, you talking about the land in the very beginning that I sold.

839
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:02.260
Sold?

840
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.180
Yeah. You sold sold. You said you sold it to like a couple

841
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.860
instead of like some type of invest. Oh,

842
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.220
This recent one? Yeah. Okay. A couple that's moving to Florida. Yeah, a realtor.

843
00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:16.180
Um, we, we posted on the m l s I just got one back last week in Vero Beach,

844
00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:21.180
Florida. Um, the guy signed my land letter and sent it back to me and then said,

845
00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.900
Hey, um, I think we got the wrong property identification number. So he's like,

846
00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:30.500
can you add that? So I had the, sent him a DocuSign and once he signed it,

847
00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:35.220
I sent it to my, my, uh, real estate agent. And this week he'll have photos,

848
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:37.620
everything in the land and have it on the m l s.

849
00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.300
And that's how we're finding most of our buyers is I'm either buying it and

850
00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:45.220
putting it on the m l s or uh, just putting my contract on the m l s,

851
00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:48.220
but sometimes I'll just assign it to a cash buyer. Um,

852
00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:51.460
sometimes the seller will say, no, I don't really want it on the m l s,

853
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:55.220
I want you to buy it. So then I'll either buy it or I'll partner with,

854
00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:57.380
with someone that has some cash to buy it,

855
00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.820
or I'll just assign my contract really quickly.

856
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:04.590
Hey Brent, you've got a notorious r and r formula.

857
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:05.870
Why don't you tell us about that?

858
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:08.270
The rinse and repeat formula?

859
00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:09.693
Yeah,

860
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.800
So it's really just, uh,

861
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.440
my rinse and repeat is having my letters going out consistently.

862
00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.840
I send out 300 letters a week and it's been pretty consistent. It's like the,

863
00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.880
the, the farmhouse pump, you know, you're pumping that red pump,

864
00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:25.640
I'm gonna go ahead and let this guy in. You're pumping this, that red pump,

865
00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:29.520
and then eventually all the air gets outta that line. And then this water,

866
00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.920
I call that my deal flow. And I just look at these deals, you know,

867
00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.160
you want to have more options, you know, it's like going to the dance.

868
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.720
When I was in middle school, I knew that if I asked at least three girls,

869
00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.360
one would hopefully say yes. Cause I didn't want to go by myself. Like I,

870
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.680
then I would be like this weirdos standing on the side. Yeah.

871
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:49.080
Even though I still didn't dance even though I had a date to go with.

872
00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:51.560
But it's the same thing with land investing.

873
00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.520
You pump enough of these land offer letters, these LOLs,

874
00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.680
you're gonna be able to deal, analyze,

875
00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:00.200
and figure out what you want to buy and what you don't wanna buy.

876
00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:03.200
And in the beginning. I got so many of those back at one time.

877
00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.800
I got overwhelmed and I put 'em in the desk drawer until I got the courage to go

878
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.680
back to 'em. And then I just figured out what they were worth and what I could,

879
00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.760
I had 'em under contract with. And I just went for,

880
00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:17.580
for one at a time that had the highest spread. And then the repeat option is,

881
00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.180
you know, again,

882
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.900
I'm going back to what I used to do when I was just getting started,

883
00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.620
but I would put these things on, on, uh, Facebook by buy sell groups,

884
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.300
Facebook marketplace. I would put 'em on Craigslist, I would put out signs.

885
00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:33.540
One time, you know, I, it was in 2000, uh, late 2016,

886
00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.620
I got a piece of land under a contract that a bank owned.

887
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.980
And they gave me 30 days to find my buyer and they let me assign the contract.

888
00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:46.380
And you know how I found them? I put out 33 signs that said 44 acres,

889
00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:51.640
38 k, my phone number. So it, there's nothing complicated about this.

890
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.553
I think I hit time.

891
00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:58.070
That's amazing. So, Brent, thank you so much. Um, and as we wrap up,

892
00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:02.830
uh, I'm checking out some of the comments here as well. Um, Rihanna,

893
00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.550
Murray was just wondering if,

894
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:08.510
if you guys have a contract that allows you to market on the MLS that she could

895
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:09.250
see,

896
00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:11.830
You want me to just uh, so yes.

897
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:16.510
Go to the land sharks.com/contract.

898
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.430
Now this is not gonna have that special verbiage.

899
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:21.790
I will give you the special verbiage right now.

900
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.740
Wow, that's amazing. He's putting it in the chat as we speak.

901
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.620
Let me just look it up. Cause I just sent it to,

902
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:32.330
And so, uh, Dimitri, uh,

903
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:35.730
he's actually posting his number and name and saying that, uh,

904
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:38.440
your network is your net worth, which we agree.

905
00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:43.160
We've actually got a Google sheet that everybody that wants to network can put

906
00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.480
their name in, in location and what they're interested in.

907
00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:49.560
And I think Ryan Hewitt is actually putting that right in the chat as well.

908
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.393
There it is.

909
00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.790
Okay. And Brent, wow. Okay. Here, here it is. Seller acknowledgement.

910
00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:02.750
Seller agrees that buyer may market this property contract for sale to another

911
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:05.030
buyer on the MLS or anywhere in a sign. All interest,

912
00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:06.470
the seller's acknowledgements,

913
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:10.590
ex executed by the seller together with this agreement is incorporated here by

914
00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:13.990
reference. So that's the piece that lets you market on the mls, right?

915
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:16.590
That's the match bullet. And now definitely,

916
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.550
definitely verify that with a real estate attorney. Guys,

917
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:23.030
don't go out there and get yourself in trouble. Um, but just,

918
00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.670
just make sure that that's okay. And, and guys,
